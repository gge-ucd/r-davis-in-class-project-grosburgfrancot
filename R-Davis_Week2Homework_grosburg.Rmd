#Week 2 Homework 



```{r}
set.seed(15)

```


```{r}
hw2 <- runif(50, 4, 50)
hw2

```


```{r}
hw2 <- replace(hw2, c(4,12,22,27), NA)
hw2
```

#PROBLEM 1:Take your hw2 vector and removed all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1.


```{r}
prob <- na.omit(hw2)
prob
```

```{r}
prob1 <- subset(prob, prob>14 & prob<=38)
prob1
```

#PROBLEM 2:Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.

```{r}
times3 <- 3*(prob1)
times3

```

```{r}
plus10 <- 10+(times3)
plus10
```


#PROBLEM 3:Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one:



```{r}
finalvector <- plus10[seq(1, length(plus10),2)]
finalvector

```


```{r}
file.edit("R-Davis_Week2hw_grosburg")
```
