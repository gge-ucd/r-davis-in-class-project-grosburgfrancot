```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Create a tibble named surveys from the portal_data_joined.csv file.



```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys
```
Subset surveys to keep rows with weight between 30 and 60, and print out the first 6 rows.

```{r}
wsurveys <- subset(surveys, surveys$weight>=30 & surveys$weight<=60)
head(wsurveys)
```

Create a new tibble showing the maximum weight for each species + sex combination and name it biggest_critters. Sort the tibble to take a look at the biggest and smallest species + sex combinations. HINT: it’s easier to calculate max if there are no NAs in the dataframe…

biggest_critters <- surveys %>%
  filter(x)%>%
  summarize())
biggest_critters


```{r}
biggest_critters <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight) & !is.na(sex) & !is.na(species)) %>%
  group_by(species,sex) %>% 
  summarise(maximum_weight = max(weight))
biggest_critters

```

```{r}
biggest_critters %>% arrange(maximum_weight)
```
```{r}
biggest_critters %>% arrange(desc(maximum_weight))
```



Try to figure out where the NA weights are concentrated in the data- is there a particular species, taxa, plot, or whatever, where there are lots of NA values? There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer here, but manipulate surveys a few different ways to explore this. Maybe use tally and arrange here.

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  filter(is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


Take surveys, remove the rows where weight is NA and add a column that contains the average weight of each species+sex combination to the full surveys dataframe. Then get rid of all the columns except for species, sex, weight, and your new average weight column. Save this tibble as surveys_avg_weight.

```{r}
surveys_avg_weight <- surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(species_id, sex) %>% 
  mutate(avg_weight = mean(weight)) %>% 
  select(species_id, sex, weight, avg_weight)

surveys_avg_weight
```
Take surveys_avg_weight and add a new column called above_average that contains logical values stating whether or not a row’s weight is above average for its species+sex combination (recall the new column we made for this tibble).


```{r}
surveys_avg_weight <- surveys_avg_weight %>% 
  mutate(above_average = weight > avg_weight)

surveys_avg_weight

```
